<h3>What is EOpedia?</h3>
<p>Weren't you searching around and crawling the internet before for a specific bit of information from the EO domain?
  This happens to me several times even though Wikipedia exists. Wikipedia is intended for the broad audience and not
  for the EO community. The information I'm looking for is either buried below all other or not contained at all. This
  is where EOpedia comes into play.<br> The intention is not to have lengthy full-blown articles but to have articles
  which provide the most essential information in a nutshell and link to the best resources on the internet.<br> If you
  want to take part and help others by sharing your knowledge, request an account. </p>
