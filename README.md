This is a plugin for [ESA SNAP](step.esa.int) which adds [EOpedia](www.eopedia.org) to the search box in the SNAP
Desktop application.

The search box can be found by default in the upper right corner of SNAP and searches within the available actions
and the help pages for the provided search term. This plugin extends this search by the EOpedia Wiki. The term is also
looked up in EOpedia and results are listed. When selected the results are shown in the system default browser.
