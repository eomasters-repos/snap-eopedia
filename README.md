# snap-eopedia

This is a plugin for [ESA SNAP](step.esa.int) which adds [EOPedia](www.eopedia.org) to the search box in the SNAP 
Desktop application.

The search box can be found by default in the upper right corner of SNAP and searches within the available actions 
and the help pages for the provided search term. This plugin extends the search by the EOPedia Wiki. The term is also looked up and results are listed. When selected 
the results are shown in the system default browser.
